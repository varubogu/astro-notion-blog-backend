# astro-notion-blog-backend

Backend API server available for use with [astro-notion-blog](https://github.com/otoyo/astro-notion-blog)

## Features

### Comment Posting

You can post comments on articles. Comments are managed in a Notion database.

To post a comment, send the following JSON to
`https://your-domain/api/v1/comments/add`:

```json
{
    "name": "Valborg",
    "comment": "This is a test comment.",
    "slug": "sample-article"
}
```

The "slug" refers to the slug used in astro-notion-blog (i.e., the part of the URL).

## Setup Instructions

### Copy the Notion Comment Database

Copy the following database and place it anywhere in your Notion workspace:
<https://sharp-spring-bac.notion.site/a74be7d72a1745fe9f229c136a43c6a8?v=2a463a38f818466bbabfe69f5d57338f&pvs=4>

### Configure Notion Integration

Create an integration and set the following permissions:
- Content Capabilities > Read content
- Content Capabilities > Insert content

Apply the created integration to both the database used by astro-notion-blog and the comment database you just copied.

For convenience, you can set up an automation to notify you via Slack when a new page is added.

### Hosting with Cloudflare Workers

Install and log in to wrangler in advance:
```bash
npm install -g wrangler
wrangler login
```

Open `wrangler.toml` and change
```toml
name = "astro-notion-blog-backend"
```
to any string you like (this will be the site name).

#### Set Environment Variables

Set the environment variables just like when deploying astro-notion-blog:
Cloudflare Workers & Pages > Select the deployed site > Settings > Variables > Environment Variables

Set the following:

| Environment Variable Name | Description |
|---|---|
| NOTION_API_SECRET | Secret for the integration used by NotionSDK |
| NOTION_DATABASE_POSTS_ID | Database ID for the blog |
| NOTION_DATABASE_COMMENTS_ID | Database ID for comments |
| MAINSITE_DOMAIN | Domain name of the site running astro-notion-blog |

If you want to run it locally, copy `.dev.vars.example` to `.dev.vars` and write in the environment variables.

#### Local Execution

```bash
npm run dev
```

#### Workers Deployment

```bash
npm run deploy
```

#### Domain Settings

(Assuming the main domain settings are already done)
Cloudflare Workers & Pages > Select the deployed site > Settings > Triggers > Add Custom Domain
Enter a name and add the custom domain.

### Hosting on Non-Cloudflare Platforms

Currently, operation on platforms other than Cloudflare has not been verified. This backend is stateless, so it can also run on FaaS platforms like AWS Lambda.
